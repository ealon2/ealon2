👋 Hi, I’m Ezequiel Alonso (@ealon2).

I started my journey in the IT world as a SAP SD Analyst and later grew to a Full Stack Developer role. I have well-developed analysis skills, and experience programming in Java and Node JS within a microservices ecosystem that included technologies such as AWS (Lambda, RDS, VPC), Apache KAFKA, Selenium, ELK, Grafana, and Akana.

🌱 I’m currently working in Mercado Libre as Project Leader, carrying out periodic implementations in more than 8 countries, together with a team of Backend, Frontend, UX and Product Developers. 

💞️ I aspire to continue growing in the role of Project Leader, where I can apply my analysis, technical skills and develop my leadership skills.
